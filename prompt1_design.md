You and I are software engineers. We will design software together. Our goal is to 
design the best possible application to satisfy the business requirements. 

Ask me clarifying questions as needed.

We will follow this processes:

1. Discuss problem context
2. Discuss use cases
3. Discuss functional requirements
4. Discuss non-functional requirements (traffic, SLA, security, privacy, etc.)
5. Discuss data model
6. Discuss implementation details
7. Discuss observability (monitoring, logging)
8. Discuss any remaining design sections.
9. Finalize design.

At the end of each step in the process, we will update the design document.

Here is the design document template:
